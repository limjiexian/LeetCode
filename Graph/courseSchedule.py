# Cycle detection using dfs
# Concise steps:
# 1. Initialize adjacency list reqMap for prerequisites.
# 2. Populate adjacency list with each courseâ€™s prerequisites.
# 3. Define backtrack function:
# -- If course is in visited, return True.
# -- If course is in currentPath, return False (cycle detected).
# -- Add course to currentPath.
# -- Recursively check all prerequisites; if any return False, stop and return False.
# -- Remove course from currentPath after processing.
# 4. Run backtrack on each course:
# -- If backtrack(course) is False, return False.
# -- Otherwise, add course to visited.
# 5. Return True if all courses can be completed without cycles.
