# Code summary:
# 1. **Build adjacency list** from edges to represent the undirected graph.

# 2. **Define `backtrack` function**:
#    - Mark `node` as visited.
#    - Traverse neighbors; if any are visited but not the parent, return `False` (cycle detected).

# 3. **Run `backtrack` from node 0**:
#    - If `backtrack` returns `False` or all nodes werenâ€™t visited, return `False` (not a valid tree).
#    - Otherwise, return `True`.
