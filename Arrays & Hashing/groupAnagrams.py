    # Mutability and Hashmap as Key:

    # Mutability: A key for a dictionary or a set must be immutable. Dictionaries (hashmaps) are mutable, meaning their contents can change (you can add, remove, or update key-value pairs). If you used a mutable object like a dictionary as a key, its hash value would change if its contents were modified. This would break the integrity of the dictionaryâ€™s internal structure because the key's hash value is used for lookups.
    # Hashability:

    # Hashability: To be used as a key in a dictionary or an element in a set, an object must be hashable. An object is hashable if it has a constant hash value throughout its lifetime, which allows it to be used in hash-based collections like dictionaries and sets.
    # Hashmaps (Dictionaries) and Hashability: In Python, dictionaries themselves are not hashable. This is because dictionaries are mutable. The hash value of a mutable object like a dictionary can change if its contents change, which makes it unsuitable for use as a key.
    # Why Hashmaps (Dictionaries) Are Not Hashable
    # Hash Function: Hashable objects need a consistent hash value, which is used by hash-based data structures for quick lookups.
